## Packages version management with Lerna.js

### ðŸ“– Docs

- [Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)

- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Settled to use `independent mode` to projects to increment package versions independently.
Lerna allows target versions of local dependent packages to be written as a `git remote url`, this allows packages to be distributed via git repositories

Version track starts from v1.0.0 at `master` branch.

Current approach rely on two workspaces:

 - `@k2-packages`, versioned application modules;

Respectively k2-packages folders.

## Setup

### Nexus repository access
Generate nexus access token 
```
npm config set registry https://nexus.kontur.io/repository/npm-a/
npm config set always-auth true
npm login
```
Copy token from `~/.npmrc`
```
sed -n 's/.*_authToken=//p' ~/.npmrc
```

Create .npmrc in a project directory.
```
//nexus.kontur.io/repository/npm-a/:_authToken=your_token_here
//nexus.kontur.io/repository/npm-snapshots-a/:_authToken=your_token_here
registry=https://nexus.kontur.io/repository/npm-a/
always-auth=true

```
Check if you logged in
```
npm whoami --registry=https://nexus.kontur.io/repository/npm-a/
```

### Package management
To add dependency to all packages.
```sh
$ lerna add @k2-packages/module3
```


To add module3 as dependency to module2.
```sh
$ lerna add @k2-packages/module3 --scope=@k2-packages/module2
```

### Git branch naming

For every feature you must create new branch in format
```
{fibery-task-id}-{tas-title}
```

Currently correct branch name generated in fibery

### Commit naming

To build automation on top of lerna and packages version management we have to follow `Conventional commits` specification.

Commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```


Must be one of the following:
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: webpack, babel, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: .env, Docker, Ansible, configs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

###  Version release
After you have finished working with the branch:
1. Push and publish it into the git:
`git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`

2. Open Merge Request (MR) into dev
 - Select `Delete source branch`
 - Select `Squash commits`
 - Write changelog in description of MR (it will be added in change log of all modules that depend on your MR)

3. Make sure that all CI stages were successful and choice reviewer

4. Make sure that all issues identified in the review process closed,
and request have at least one :like: (not yours). If CI/CD pipeline without errors - accept MR.

If you need release modules in NPM nexus repo, you need some extra steps:

5. Clone fresh `master` branch with merged request
6. `npm run release`
7. Wait until pipeline task 'release' was success
8. Rebuild the app where you want to use the new modules

> is something wrong in CI as workaround you can run `npm run publish` manually


### Localization
Localization done with a complete solution of i18next.
Each product build on top of k2 platform:

- Initialize i18nex object [Example](https://gitlab.com/kontur-private/kcloud/kcfirebrigade-fe/-/blob/master/src/i18n/index.ts)
- Define localization files location [Example](https://gitlab.com/kontur-private/kcloud/kcfirebrigade-fe/-/tree/master/src/locales)
- Add language selector [Example](https://gitlab.com/kontur-private/kcloud/kcfirebrigade-fe/-/blob/master/src/components/HomePage/index.tsx#L205)

To extract translation keys:

Declare the plugin like any other plugin in your .babelrc and you're good to go:
```
{
  "plugins": [
    "i18next-extract",
    ...
  ]
}
```

Once the plugin is setup, you can build your app normally or run Babel through Babel CLI:

`yarn run babel -f .babelrc 'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'`

Extracted translations land in the extractedTranslations/ directory by default.
